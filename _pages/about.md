I am a PhD student at Université de Montréal supervised by <a href="https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~bmpix/">Mikhail Bessmeltsev</a>. I'm a member of the <a href="http://www.ligum.umontreal.ca/">LIGUM</a>.

My research focuses on geometry processing, with a particular interest to winding numbers and differentiable rendering.

I graduated from Concordia University in 2022 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering.
